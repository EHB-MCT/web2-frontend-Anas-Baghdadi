### API Integration

1. Obtain an API Key:
    To access the Spoonacular API, you'll need to sign up for an API key from their official website.
    Once you have your API key, you can include it in the relevant parts of the code.
    
2. Making API Requests:
    We use the fetch function to make API requests to the Spoonacular API endpoints.
    The API endpoints are used to generate meal plans, retrieve recipes, and fetch nutritional information.
    
3. Processing API Responses:
    The data retrieved from the API is processed and displayed to users on the application's interface.
    Nutritional information, recipe images, and other relevant data are extracted from the API response.
    
4. Linking to Full Recipes:
    Each recipe card in MealMagic provides a link to the full recipe on the Spoonacular website. This link is generated using the sourceUrl from the API response.
